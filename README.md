I received the B.Sc. degree (Hons.) from the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Yaşar University, Izmir, Turkey. I am currently pursuing the Master’s degree in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) for the Internet and multimedia in the Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Padua, Italy. During my senior year, I worked as a Research Scholar in the Scientific Research Project “Development of Channel Models and Techniques for Visible Light Communication” at Yaşar University.

My graduation project “Video Transmission via Visible Light Communication,” was supported by TÜBİTAK (Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey) under the 2209-B Industry Focused Undergraduate Thesis Support Program. My team’s low-cost VLC system design was published at the 2019 Conference on Innovations in Intelligent Systems and Applications. My research interests are machine learning and its applications to multimedia technologies.
